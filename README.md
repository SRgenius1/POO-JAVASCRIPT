# POO IN JS

- You will see how to work with class syntax in javascript
- Everything in javascript is an object
- in javascript we don't have classes but prototypes
## What does this proyect contain
#### We apply the 4 pillars of object-oriented programming with javascript
- INHERITANCE
- ABSTRACTION
- POLYMORPHISM
- ENCAPSULATION

## we learn the syntax of
- CLASS (class)
- INSTANCES (new name(...))
- EXTENDS (extends className {..})
- ENCAPSULATION (_ and methods)

## What is this project about?
- we have the logic of an online education platform
- where we have classes of teachers, students, comments, courses and classes of the courses
- we have instances of all classes
- all classes have attributes and some have methods
- some of the classes implement encapsulation, hiding themselves so people can't access their "private" properties
- we apply polymorphism in some instances of classes to modify the use of some methods
